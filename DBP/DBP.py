        # The idea here is that a fully-stable position is one for which all elements in the heightmap which are coverd by the bottom
        # area of the box hold the same value. If this condition can be detected for every position in the heightmap that a given box
        # can occupy, then the problem of finding all stable positions for a specific box is solved. Here, we use an approximate
        # method to compute this condition with a high degree of certainty:

        # For every key (every possible box bottom area) in the Stability Dictionary:
        for k,v in stab_dict.items():

            # Create a custom heightmap with all positions initially declared unstable
            stab = np.zeros(hm.shape)

            w = int(k/(self.max_size-1) + 1) # Get the width of the box
            l = int(k%(self.max_size-1) + 1) # Get the length of the box

            # Build an all ones kernel from the dimensions. Ex: (w,l)=(1,2) ---> kernel = [1 1]
            # This kernel is nothing more than a matrix representation of the box
            kernel = np.ones((1,w,l))        

            # Here is the trick: in order to asses for each position if the elements under the kernel are the same, we perform a 
            # correlation between the kernel and the Heightmap. Because all kernel elements are 1, this is reduced to a simple average.
            # If the average of all elements under the kernel equals the value of an individual element, it is assumed there is a high 
            # chance that all elements are the same. In order to increase the certainty that this holds, the same procedure is done
            # with the hightmap squared: if the average of all elements squared also equals the value of an individual element squared,
            # there is an even higher chance that all elements are the same. Therefore:

            conv1 = sg.correlate(hm,kernel, mode='valid')/(w*l)     #Correlate the kernel with the heightmap and normalize
            conv2 = sg.correlate(hm_sq,kernel, mode='valid')/(w*l)  #Correlate the kernel with the heightmap squared and normalize

            mask1 = (hm[:,:conv1.shape[1],:conv1.shape[2]] == conv1).astype(int)     # Assess 1st order stability
            mask2 = (hm_sq[:,:conv2.shape[1],:conv2.shape[2]] == conv2).astype(int)  # Assess 2nd order stability

            # Cells which hold stable for both 1st and 2nd order stability for a given box are deemed stable placements for this box
            stab[:,:conv1.shape[1],:conv1.shape[2]] = mask1*mask2 # Combine the 1st and 2nd order assessments
